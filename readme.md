####a social project management system

`note: this project is only a rough idea yet!` 

##aim
The aim of 'projects' is to develop a decentralized social project management system that can be run on a simple php/mysql-webserver.

###why social?
I want to create a kind of social network where you can work on projects, comment them, like them, connect to people on other servers, develop code in thee browser, versioning the code, share tasks and events and many many more.

##technology
projects is based on server-side php and mysql and client-side jQuery (ajax) and twitter Bootstrap with Font-Awesome-Icons (and standard html/css/javascript).

The php-part is based on a self-developed MVC-System.
